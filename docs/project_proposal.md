# Project Proposal - MLinAPP

## Project Title, Project Number and Project Owner
AM04, Dataset Augmentation for Additive Manufacturing defect detection - 2024/02  - Alessio Mascolini

## Project Team
Gabriele Ferro (s308552), Giovanni Gaddi (s308685), Filippo Greco (s309529), Stiven Hidri (s315147)

## Project Background
The project came by the need for bigger datasets when data is scarce. Our team, composed of the above-mentioned 4 people, will work on the described project, after it was proposed by Alessio Masolini - the project owner. One of the main challenges will be applying augmentation techniques that we have never seen before. We were motivated especially by the industrial application of the project and by the urgency of companies to augment datasets when their base is not large enough. 

## Project Scope
Ideally, we want to pursuit the following goals:
1.	Read the corresponding literature to have a wider point of view of the problem.
2.	Analyze the data by visualization and various metrics.
3.	Implement a neural network for classification of the images.
4.	Implement some harmonization algorithms to increase the dataset dimension and so the accuracy of our model. 
5.	Write a final report that describes our overall work.
We leave to future implementations the following ideas that are outside our scope:
1.	…?

## High-Level Requirements
HW Requirements:
We kindly request the use of PoliTO servers for computational resources to expedite the testing of our models. While it is possible to run the workload on some of our machines, we cannot be certain that they will be sufficient. Additionally, some of our members do not have GPUs on their PCs.
SW Requirements:
1.	VS Code text editor with the SSH plugin for remote coding on PoliTO servers.
2.	Public GitHub repository available at: https://github.com/figimodi/AML-egovision
3.	Telegram for internal communications among members.

## Implementation Plan
We would like to implement the following solutions:
1.	Using already existing implementations, try Lenet, AlexNet, ResNet for classification and some other mixture of CNNs architectures.
2.	Implement the literatures’ harmonization architectures (CNN-based, GANs), make a comparison among them, and chose the best one.
